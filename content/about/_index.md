# About

CasADi is written in modern C++ code, and licensed under the LGPL, meaning the code can be used royalty-free even in commercial applications.
Interfaces to other Python, Octave, Matlab are provided through [SWIG](http://www.swig.org).

## Source
The source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/casadi/casadi).
While the core depends only on the C++ Standard Library, [source builds](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/SourceBuild) can be daunting because of the interfaces to numerical codes. We highly recommend following the [Try/install page](../get) instead.
