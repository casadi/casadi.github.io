## CasADi master class

**16-18 March 2020 – Leuven, Belgium**

(download this description as [flyer](master2020.pdf))

### Target audience
Academic/industrial CasADi users that want to get a deeper understanding of CasADi, in order to speed up existing applications or create advanced implementations. Unlike the [fall course](../ocp2020), there is no focus on mathematics.

### CasADi?
Originating from KU Leuven’s “Optimization in Engineering Center” under guidance of prof. Moritz Diehl, [CasADi](http://casadi.org) [1] is an open-source software framework for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation. It facilitates rapid - yet efficient - implementation of different methods for numerical optimal control, both in an offline context and for nonlinear model predictive control.

### Format
Seminars paired with computer exercises. The seminars provide a view on advanced CasADi techniques. The computer exercises aim to internalize these techniques, and leave the participants well-equipped to apply them on their own applications.

### Covered CasADi topics
SX and MX expression graphs - benchmarking and debugging - thread-safety and parallelisation - code generation API and C API - interfacing an NLP solver to CasADi - memory/speed trade-offs and algorithmic differentiation

### Prerequisites
Basic programming skills are assumed. Exercises will build upon boilerplate codes in Python/Matlab, C and C++. Familiarity with CasADi is assumed.

### Tutor
Joris Gillis obtained his PhD in electrical engineering at KU Leuven in 2015. Currently a post-doc at MECO, KU Leuven and part-time freelancer, he pursues large-scale applications in optimal control and is highly active as a main developer of CasADi since 2010.

### Practicalities
The course will take place at the Park Inn hotel, Martelarenlaan 36, 3010 Leuven, Belgium, starting each day at 9:00 and ending on 18:00.
The registration fee amounts to 750 EUR excl. VAT (450 EUR for PhD students). This includes lunches and a social dinner on March 17. Lodging is not included.

Participants are required to bring their own laptops (Linux/Windows/Mac). A working installation of either Matlab or Python is needed, as well as a C compiler, and either Virtualbox or VMware Workstation Player.

### Registration

Register before March 1, 2020, on the [google form](https://forms.gle/CWy6Zz3YU8UD7mXi9) – the event is limited to 30 participants.
