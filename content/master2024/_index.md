## CasADi master class

**March 18-20, 2024 – Leuven, Belgium**

(download this description as [flyer](master2024.pdf))

### Target audience
Academic/industrial CasADi users that want to get a deeper understanding of CasADi, in order to speed up existing applications or create advanced implementations. Unlike the [fall course](../ocp2024), there is no focus on mathematics.

### CasADi?
Originating from KU Leuven’s “Optimization in Engineering Center” under guidance of prof. Moritz Diehl, [CasADi](http://casadi.org) [1] is an open-source software framework for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation. It facilitates rapid - yet efficient - implementation of different methods for numerical optimal control, both in an offline context and for nonlinear model predictive control.

### Format
Seminars paired with computer exercises. The seminars provide a view on advanced CasADi techniques. The computer exercises aim to internalize these techniques, and leave the participants well-equipped to apply them on their own applications.

### Covered topics
SX and MX expression graphs - benchmarking and debugging - thread-safety and parallelisation - code generation API and C API - memory/speed trade-offs and algorithmic differentiation

### Prerequisites
Basic programming skills are assumed. Exercises will build upon boilerplate codes in Python/Matlab, C and C++. Familiarity with CasADi is assumed.

### Tutor
Joris Gillis obtained his PhD in electrical engineering at KU Leuven in 2015. Currently active at MECO, KU Leuven and part-time freelancer, he pursues large-scale applications in optimal control and is highly active as a main developer of CasADi since 2010.

### Practicalities
The course will take place at the Park Inn hotel, Martelarenlaan 36, 3010 Leuven, Belgium, starting each day at 9:00 and ending at 18:00.
Participants are required to bring their own laptops (Linux/Windows/Mac). A working installation of either Matlab or Python is needed, as well as a C compiler (gcc/clang/msvc).

### Registration

The registration fee amounts to 1050 EUR excl. VAT (850 EUR for PhD students). Early bird discount (75 EUR) applies until January 28. The registration fee covers for daily mini-breakfasts, refreshments during the breaks, and lunch. A joint dinner is included on Tuesday evening. Lodging is not included.

The number of participants is capped to 20. Registration closes February 25.
