      <description>Welcome to CasADi’s documentation!¶ 1. Introduction¶ CasADi is an open-source software tool for numerical optimization in general and optimal control (i.e. optimization involving differential equations) in particular. The project was started by Joel Andersson and Joris Gillis while PhD students at the Optimization in Engineering Center (OPTEC) of the KU Leuven under supervision of Moritz Diehl.
This document aims at giving a condensed introduction to CasADi. After reading it, you should be able to formulate and manipulate expressions in CasADi’s symbolic framework, generate derivative information efficiently using algorithmic differentiation, to set up, solve and perform forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) or differential-algebraic equations (DAE) as well as to formulate and solve nonlinear programs (NLP) problems and optimal control problems (OCP).</description>

      <description>Source Outline CasADi is written in modern C++ code, and licensed under the LGPL, meaning the code can be used royalty-free even in commercial applications. Interfaces to other Python, Octave, Matlab are provided through SWIG.
Source builds The source code is hosted on Github. While the core depends only on the C++ Standard Library, source builds can be daunting because of the interfaces to numerical codes. We highly recommend following the Try/install page instead.</description>

      <description>Support Community If you find simple bugs or lack some feature that you think would be relatively easy for us to add, the simplest thing is simply to write to the forum. We read the forum post regularly and try to respond as soon as possible. The only thing we expect for this kind of support is that you cite us, whenever you use CasADi in scientific work. There is also an onboarding guide with FAQ over at the CasADi wiki</description>
